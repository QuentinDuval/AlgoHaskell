-- | FIFO queue implementation
-- This implementation works great in persistent settings
-- By using a schedule, it trades amortized bounds to worse-case bounds

-- Invariants:
-- * The back queue cannot be more than 1 bigger than the front queue
-- * No size tacking is needed for when to reverse, we can use the schedule
--
-- Remaining issues:
-- * Left associative list catenation means reconstructing the font many time
-- * In practice, the rear list doubles each time, so the effect is reduced
